## Introduction
A block cipher is a method of encrypting data in blocks to produce ciphertext using a cryptographic key and algorithm. The block cipher processes fixed-size blocks simultaneously, as opposed to a stream cipher, which encrypts data one bit at a time. Most modern block ciphers are designed to encrypt data in fixed-size blocks of either 64 or 128 bits.

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Test
```bash
python tests/test.py
```

## Description
The implemented hash algorithm is composed of several layers of abstraction:
